# ECT/ITS Lab Notebook Cheatsheet

## ITS Network Conventions (aka Local Best Practices)
These conventions MUST be used for IP address assignment. These conventions will be in effect for all assignments for the entire semester.
- A. Default Gateway (Router) will use the last usable address in the IP Network
- B. All other static assigned IPs (including other routers that are not the default gateway) start at the beginning of the range
- C. DHCP pools are between the statically addressed clients and the Default Gateway
- D. Unless indicated otherwise use the following DNS Name servers: 132.235.9.75, 132.235.200.41

### Wireshark
Display Filter
```
ip.addr==X.X.X.X
```
#### Common Network Diagnostic Commands
- `ipconfig /all` - [Windows] or `nmcli` [Ubuntu] Used to display basic network card configuration information
- `ping` - Used to check if a host is reachable across a network or to display the round-trip time for information traveling to or from the host
- `traceroute` [Ubuntu] or `tracert` [Windows] - Used to display the IP addresses and/or host names of all the routers between your host and another host, including round trip times to each of the intermediate routers. Nearly always use the -d [Windows] or -n option [Ubuntu] to disable DNS resolution.
- `netstat` [Windows] or `ss` - [Ubuntu] Used to display the Network status information for your particular host operating system. This can include existing network connections as well as routing information (i.e. how to reach other hosts if more than one network interface exists on the host)
- `tnc` [Windows/PowerShell] aka Test Network Connection has many of the features of ipconfig, Ping and Traceroute in one app. For a list of features use `man tnc` (Note: ONLY works in a PowerShell window).
- `dig` - Used to convert host names to IPv4 addresses or vice-versa. Web version: http://digwebinterface.com
- `nslookup` - Also used to convert hostnames to IPv4 addresses. A deprecated version of this command still exists in most major operating systems
- `Resolve-DNSName` [Windows/PowerShell] converts hostnames to IPs 

### VyOS Config

#### Vernacular and Definitions

- **Host** - A computer or other device that generates packets and transmits them to other hosts on a network (LAN or WAN). Hosts often include clients and servers that send or receive data, services and applications. Hosts are not network devices like switches and routers, which are categorized as network nodes.

- **GNS3** - GNS3 is application that run in the gHost (like MS-Word runs in/on Windows). It allows the combination of virtual and real devices, used to simulate complex networks. It can also be used to experiment features or to check configurations that need to be deployed later on real devices.

- **Virtual Machine** - A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

- **Command Line Interface** - A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including MS-DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS.

- **Graphical User Interface** - A graphical user interface (GUI) is a user interface that includes graphical elements, such as windows, icons and buttons. The term was created in the 1970s to distinguish graphical interfaces from text-based ones, such as command line interfaces. However, today nearly all digital interfaces are GUIs.

- **Network Interface Card** - A network interface controller (NIC, also known as a network interface card, network adapter, ethernet card, LAN adapter or physical network interface, and several other similar terms) is the Layer 1 computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network (can be wired or wireless).

- **Secure Shell (SSH)** - Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. SSH is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems, but it can also be used on Microsoft Windows. Windows 10 uses OpenSSH as its default SSH client and SSH server.
